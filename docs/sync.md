# sync

Read when: running continuous capture, one-shot sync, contact/group refresh, or background media download.

`wacli sync` requires an existing authenticated store and never displays a QR code. It captures WhatsApp Web events into the local SQLite store.

Startup repairs historical LID identities using indexed message lookups without rebuilding unchanged search content. Interrupting startup stops identity repair between individual identities; the next run resumes any remaining repairs.

Remote logout stops sync and emits `logged_out`; it retains the existing successful-stop exit status. `auth status` and `doctor` remember the observed revocation until a confirmed login.

## Command

```bash
wacli sync [--once] [--follow] [--idle-exit 30s] [--max-reconnect 5m] [--stale-threshold DURATION] [--presence-mode normal|quiet] [--send-spacing DURATION|MIN-MAX] [--max-messages N] [--max-db-size SIZE] [--download-media] [--refresh-contacts] [--refresh-groups] [--refresh-channels] [--events] [--webhook URL] [--webhook-secret SECRET] [--webhook-events LIST]
```

## Modes

- Default behavior follows continuously.
- `--once` exits after sync becomes idle.
- `--idle-exit` controls idle exit timing in once mode.
- `--max-reconnect 0` keeps reconnecting indefinitely.
- If WhatsApp revokes the linked session, sync emits a terminal `logged_out` event, cancels any reconnect already in progress, and exits cleanly. Re-pair with `wacli auth logout` followed by `wacli auth --phone`.
- `--max-messages N` stops before storing more than `N` total messages locally.
- `--max-db-size SIZE` stops when `wacli.db` plus SQLite sidecars reaches `SIZE` (`500MB`, `2GB`, etc.).
- `--download-media` runs a bounded media downloader for sync events. Clean one-shot and bootstrap runs finish queued downloads before exiting; cancellation, errors, and storage-limit exits stop immediately.
- `--send-spacing DURATION|MIN-MAX` paces serialized operations delegated to a running follow process. A single duration such as `2s` sets a fixed minimum gap; a range such as `500ms-5s` chooses a fresh random gap for each operation. It is disabled by default. With or without pacing, the caller's command timeout includes time queued behind earlier operations, pacing, and the operation itself; a request that is still queued when its caller's deadline is reached is refused with an explicit "it was not sent" error and is never dispatched later (#446). If the caller times out waiting for a reply after dispatch, the error says the operation may still have gone through, so check before retrying. Delegated `chats mark-read` and `chats mark-unread` share this queue and timeout budget.
- `--refresh-contacts` imports contacts from the session store.
- `--refresh-groups` fetches joined groups live and updates local group metadata and participant snapshots.
- `--refresh-channels` fetches subscribed WhatsApp Channels live and updates local chat rows.
- `--webhook URL` posts successfully stored live message events as JSON on a bounded background worker. The payload includes `ChatName` when a locally resolved chat name is available.
- `--webhook-secret SECRET` signs webhook payloads with `X-Wacli-Signature: sha256=<hmac>`.
- `--webhook-events LIST` selects which event types are posted, as a comma-separated list of `message`, `receipt`, and `chat_presence`. The default is `message`, which preserves the earlier message event shape. A list that omits `message` stops message posts, so `--webhook-events receipt` posts receipts only. `chat_presence` needs `--presence-mode normal` (the default): WhatsApp only sends typing notifications to devices that mark themselves available. See [Webhook payloads](#webhook-payloads).
- Webhook delivery is best-effort: failures, request timeouts, and full-queue drops are logged as warnings and do not stop sync. Retries/backoff are intentionally out of scope for this flag.
- If neither storage cap is configured, sync prints one warning because WhatsApp history can grow the local database substantially.
- `WACLI_SYNC_MAX_MESSAGES` and `WACLI_SYNC_MAX_DB_SIZE` apply the same caps to `auth` bootstrap sync and `sync`.
- After `sync --follow` finishes startup and opens its local delegate socket, these commands for the same store are delegated to it so they do not fail on the store lock:
  - `send text`, `send file`, `send sticker`, `send voice`, `send react`, `send location`, `send poll`, and `send select`.
  - `poll vote`, `presence typing`, `presence paused`, and `messages edit`.
  - `chats mark-read` and `chats mark-unread`.
- `send status` and the other chat-state commands (`archive`/`unarchive`, `pin`/`unpin`, `mute`/`unmute`) are not delegated and still require the direct store lock.
- After connecting, sync fetches WhatsApp chat app-state deltas (`regular_high` and `regular_low`) so starred, delete-for-me, mute, archive, pin, and mark-read changes made while `wacli` was offline are caught up instead of relying only on live push notifications.
- Sync imports messages sent from your other linked devices into the destination chat with `from_me=true`, so local history covers both incoming and outgoing conversation sides.
- Sync decrypts encrypted message edits and updates the original local row only when the authenticated sender, chat, and target message match. Malformed, redirected, or unsupported edits are rejected without changing local history or emitting a message webhook.
- If whatsmeow reports an app-state LTHash mismatch, sync attempts one full refresh for that collection before requesting a phone snapshot. Recovery uses a durable intent and ordered local persistence; interrupted work is replayed at the next startup before incremental fetches. Full refresh and phone recovery have independent timeouts, and each collection gets at most one automatic recovery sequence per sync run. Failed recovery retains its intent and emits a warning while normal message/history handling continues.
- Sync stores WhatsApp call signaling and call-log metadata in `call_events`; inspect it with `wacli calls list`.
- Sync stores WhatsApp status broadcasts in `status_messages`, separate from normal chat `messages`.
- Sync stores location pins and live-location shares in `message_locations`, keyed by (`chat_jid`, `msg_id`); the message row keeps `media_type=location` (or `live_location`). Pins synced before this table existed have no coordinates and cannot be backfilled.
- In an interactive terminal, routine connected/history/progress updates share one updating stderr status line. Warnings and errors still print as separate lines so they remain visible.
- `--stale-threshold DURATION` in follow mode detects keepalive failures. If whatsmeow reports that the last successful keepalive is older than this duration, sync force-closes the connection and reconnects. Healthy quiet sessions are not reconnected just because no chat events arrive. Disabled by default (`0`); accepted values are `1s` up to but not including `2m20s`, which reserves one maximum keepalive probe interval plus response deadline before whatsmeow's own 3-minute auto-reconnect window.
- `--presence-mode normal|quiet` controls global linked-device presence during sync. `normal` is the default and preserves the existing behavior: sync sends available presence after connecting or receiving a push-name update, then sends unavailable presence on cleanup. `quiet` suppresses the available-presence sends while keeping the final unavailable cleanup; use it for personal-number mirrors where keeping primary-phone notifications audible matters. WhatsApp ultimately controls notification routing, so this mode avoids the active linked-device signal but cannot guarantee phone behavior on every platform.
- A `stale` NDJSON event is emitted when the threshold is exceeded, containing `threshold`, `idle_duration`, `error_count`, and `source` fields.
- While `sync --follow` is running, a `HEARTBEAT` file is written to the store directory (at most once per minute) with the last observed follow activity timestamp in RFC 3339 format. External watchdogs or `wacli doctor` can read this as an activity marker; quiet healthy sessions may not update it because successful keepalives are silent, and keepalive health is reported separately through `stale` events.
- `--events` emits one NDJSON lifecycle event per stderr line for machine consumers. Routine human progress/status lines, interrupt prompts, and command errors are emitted as events while events are enabled.
- `offline_sync_preview` reports the server's announced reconnect backlog with `total`, `messages`, `receipts`, `notifications`, and `app_data_changes`; `offline_sync_completed` reports the server's final `count`. Without `--events`, both print as status lines. Completion can arrive without a preview, including when there is no backlog.
- These are server replay signals on stderr. Webhooks use a separate background queue, so completion does not mean queued HTTP deliveries have finished. Storage failures or webhook drops can also make delivery counts differ from the announced counts. Do not use these signals to classify individual webhook messages as replayed or live. Webhook payloads keep their existing shape.

## Webhook payloads

Webhook payloads remain flat JSON objects. Receipt and chat-presence payloads carry
an `EventType` discriminator. Message payloads deliberately omit it so existing
consumers retain the established object shape; a missing `EventType` means
`message`. Every JID field uses the same identity namespace as the local store:
known LIDs are resolved to phone JIDs, while unknown LIDs remain unchanged. Every
`Timestamp` is UTC (RFC 3339, `Z`), independent of the host's zone, matching the
store and the CLI's JSON output.

Messages use the stored live message payload documented above:

```json
{"Chat":"15551234567@s.whatsapp.net","ID":"3EB0…","SenderJID":"15551234567@s.whatsapp.net","Timestamp":"2026-07-25T10:00:00Z","FromMe":false,"Text":"hi","ChatName":"Alice"}
```

Media messages include a `Media` object containing only `Type`, `Caption`, `Filename`, `MimeType`, and `FileLength`; messages without media retain `Media: null`. Attachment retrieval fields (`MediaKey`, `DirectPath`, `FileSHA256`, and `FileEncSHA256`) are not exported. Older releases exposed these fields unintentionally: consumers that downloaded from them should use `--download-media` or `media download` instead. Local download and retry data remains available in the store. Review retained webhook logs and queues from older releases for attachment keys.

`EventType: "receipt"` reports delivery and read state for messages you sent. Only
`delivered`, `read`, and `played` cross the webhook; the protocol bookkeeping types
(`sender`, `retry`, `read-self`, `played-self`, `inactive`, `server-error`, `peer_msg`,
`hist_sync`) are dropped at the source so they cannot crowd out real messages. The
`delivered` type is spelled out explicitly, even though WhatsApp sends it as an empty
string on the wire. `MessageIDs` keeps WhatsApp's batching (one POST per receipt, not per message,
minus any blank IDs), and in groups `Sender` is the participant the receipt came
from:

```json
{"EventType":"receipt","Chat":"120363000000000000@g.us","Sender":"15551234567@s.whatsapp.net","MessageIDs":["3EB0…"],"Timestamp":"2026-07-25T10:00:01Z","Type":"delivered","IsFromMe":false}
```

`EventType: "chat_presence"` reports per-chat typing state. `Media` is `audio` while the
contact records a voice message and empty otherwise. Global presence (`online` / last
seen) is deliberately not forwarded:

```json
{"EventType":"chat_presence","Chat":"15551234567@s.whatsapp.net","Sender":"15551234567@s.whatsapp.net","State":"composing","Media":""}
```
