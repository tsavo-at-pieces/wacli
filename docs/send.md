# send

Read when: sending text, files, stickers, locations, polls, contact cards, events, view-once media, status broadcasts, quoted replies, or reactions.

`wacli send` requires authentication, a live connection, and writable mode. Send attempts are bounded and retry once after reconnect for known stale-session/usync timeout failures. `Sent to ...` and JSON `sent: true` mean WhatsApp accepted the send request and returned a message ID; they do not confirm recipient delivery. After a successful send, wacli keeps the connection alive briefly so whatsmeow can handle retry receipts from devices that could not decrypt the first copy. Repeated send commands within 5 seconds print a stderr warning so tight loops make WhatsApp rate-limit/account-risk visible.

When `sync --follow` is already running for the same store, send commands delegate the send to that running process instead of opening a second WhatsApp session. This keeps scripts usable while continuous sync owns the store lock.

```

## Recipients

- `send text`, `send file`, `send sticker`, `send voice`, and `send location` accept a JID, phone number, or synced contact/group/chat name.
- Channel JIDs use `...@newsletter`; `send text` and `send file` can target channels when the authenticated account has posting permission.
- If a name matches multiple recipients, interactive terminals prompt.
- In scripts, use `--pick N` to choose a displayed match.
- Phone numbers may use common formatting such as `+1 (234) 567-8900`.
- `send text` rejects the linked account's own phone-number or LID target by default. Pass `--allow-self` to explicitly attempt the send. WhatsApp may acknowledge these self-DMs without delivering them to Message Yourself, so `sent: true` still does not confirm device delivery. The flag also works when the send is delegated through a running `sync --follow` process.
- Restart `sync --follow` after upgrading before using `--allow-self`: an older daemon retains its self-send rejection, which the CLI reports as an error. Upgrading the CLI does not change an already-running daemon.

## Replies and reactions

- `send text` fetches Open Graph metadata for the first `http://` or `https://` URL and sends it as a WhatsApp link preview.
- Preview metadata fetches time out after 10 seconds and fall back to plain text.
- Pass `--no-preview` to disable link-preview fetching.
- `--ephemeral` sends text with `ContextInfo.Expiration`, matching the disappearing-send path. For groups, wacli uses the live group timer when available; otherwise it falls back to a 7-day default. Set `--ephemeral-duration` to choose an explicit expiration.
- `--message` is literal by default. Pass `--message-escapes` to interpret `\n`, `\r`, `\t`, `\\`, and `\"` before sending.
- Use repeatable `--mention USER` with a phone number or user JID to add WhatsApp mentions to `send text`.
- `send text --reply-to` reconstructs the stored text or supported media quote content (image, video/GIF, audio, document, or sticker); stored media must have complete sync metadata.
- Other send commands use `--reply-to` to quote a stored message ID.
- For unsynced group replies, pass `--reply-to-sender`.
- `send react` defaults to thumbs-up.
- Pass `--reaction ""` to clear a reaction.
- Sent reactions are stored locally immediately, including reaction target and display text.
- For group reactions, pass `--sender` for the original message sender.
- Use `--post-send-wait 0` to disable the retry-receipt grace window for latency-sensitive scripts.
- If any send command (text, file, voice, sticker, status, react, poll, poll vote, select, or message forward) delivers a message but recording it in local history fails (disk full, locked store), the command still succeeds with the delivered id and prints a warning to stderr; JSON output carries the failure in `store_warning`, including for sends delegated to a running `sync --follow` process. Do not retry such a send — the recipient already has the message.

## Polls

- `send poll` accepts 2-12 repeatable `--option` values.
- `--multi N` sets how many options a voter may select. The default is `1`.
- Outbound single-select polls use WhatsApp's V3 poll creation field. Multi-select polls use the base poll creation field. Community announcement groups use V2 when live group metadata identifies the target as both announce-only and a community parent.
- Incoming polls and poll votes are stored during sync in the local poll tables.
- `poll vote` validates selected options when the original poll is present in the local store.
- For unsynced group polls, pass `--sender` with the poll author's JID.
- `poll show` prints current aggregates and per-voter selections from the local store. JSON output includes `unknown_hashes` for vote hashes that could not be matched to a stored option.
- `polls list` shows recently synced or sent polls, optionally filtered with `--chat`.

## Buttons and lists

- `send select` selects a stored inbound WhatsApp quick-reply button or list row.
- Sync the target chat first, then pass the inbound button or list message ID with `--id`.
- Select exactly one option with `--label`, `--button-id`, or `--index`.
- `--label` matches stored display text exactly after trimming whitespace. Ambiguous labels fail before sending.
- `--button-id` matches the stored WhatsApp option ID exactly after trimming whitespace.
- `--index` is 1-indexed and counts selectable controls only. URL buttons, call buttons, and list container buttons are excluded.
- Use `--type list_row` or `--type quick_reply` to narrow the candidate set.
- List rows from older stores are safely inferred as list responses, but older quick replies without `response_type` fail with a sync-again error.
- Synced list rows and plain quick replies send the selected display text as a quoted reply to the original message.
- This intentionally treats selection as a quoted text reply, not as a synthetic phone-tap event.
- Native-flow quick replies are detected but not sent yet; wacli returns an explicit unsupported error instead of guessing the wire format.
- Sent selections are stored locally as `Selected: <display text>` and support JSON output for scripts.

## Status broadcasts

- `send status` posts to WhatsApp's `status@broadcast` target.
- `--message` or `--file` is required.
- Text statuses use `--message`; media statuses use `--file` and can use `--message` as the caption.
- Text statuses accept `--background-color` as `#RRGGBB` or `#AARRGGBB`.
- Text statuses accept `--font N` to pass a WhatsApp text status font number.
- Media statuses reuse the normal upload path, including MIME detection and `--mime` overrides.
- Sent and synced statuses are stored in the local `status_messages` table, separate from normal chat `messages`. Read them with [`wacli status`](status.md).
- `send status` is delegated to a running `sync --follow` like the other sends; `--file` is passed as an absolute path.

## Locations

- `send location` sends a native WhatsApp location pin from decimal degrees.
- `--latitude` and `--longitude` are both required and must be finite; latitude is bounded to -90..90 and longitude to -180..180. Both flags must be passed explicitly, because 0,0 is a real coordinate and cannot be distinguished from an omitted flag.
- `--name` is optional and labels the pin; it is omitted from the message when empty.
- A pin carries no caption, mentions, or quoted reply: `LocationMessage` has no field for them.
- Received and sent pins are stored in the `message_locations` table (`chat_jid`, `msg_id`, `latitude`, `longitude`, `name`, `address`, `is_live`), and the message row records `media_type=location` with the display text `Sent location`. Live location shares are stored the same way with `is_live=1`.
- Coordinates are removed by `messages purge` and by the chat cleanup commands, on the same terms as any other retained message payload. See [store](store.md).
- Locations synced before this table existed have no coordinates and cannot be backfilled.

## Files

- Set `WACLI_MEDIA_ROOTS` to a colon-separated list of absolute directories to confine which local files `send file`, `send voice`, `send sticker` and `send status --file` may upload. The file must resolve, symlinks included, to a path inside one of them; anything else is refused before the store is opened or a running `sync --follow` is asked to send. Unset keeps the default of no restriction. It is a guardrail for agents driving the CLI, so a prompt-injected request cannot attach an arbitrary file from the machine.
- File uploads are capped at 100 MiB.
- MIME type is detected automatically unless `--mime` is set.
- WhatsApp derives the message bubble (image, video, audio, or document) from the message type, which wacli picks from the MIME by default. Use `--as auto|document|audio|image|video` to force it. For example, `--mime audio/mpeg --as document` delivers an mp3 as a downloadable document instead of an inline audio bubble, matching how the mobile app attaches files. `--as auto` (the default) keeps MIME-based detection. `--ptt` only accepts `--as auto` or `--as audio`.
- `--filename` changes the displayed document name.
- Captions apply to images, videos, and documents.
- Files sent to channels use WhatsApp's unencrypted newsletter media upload path and include the upstream media handle required by `whatsmeow`.
- Quoted file replies and `--ptt` voice-note mode are not supported for channel sends.
- `send sticker` requires 512x512 WebP input. Static stickers are capped at 100 KiB; animated stickers are capped at 500 KiB and are sent with animation metadata.
- `send voice` is a shortcut for `send file --ptt`.
- Voice notes require OGG/Opus audio (`audio/ogg; codecs=opus`).
- When available, `ffprobe` sets voice-note duration and `ffmpeg` generates the 64-sample waveform from decoded PCM audio.
- Waveform decoding is capped at 2 MiB (about 131 seconds). Longer voice notes use that initial segment for the waveform; the complete audio file and its full duration are still sent. Failed decodes omit the optional waveform.

## Contact cards

- `send contact` shares a vCard for each `--contact`. One contact is sent as a single card; repeat `--contact` to send several as one contacts message.
- `--contact` accepts a JID, a phone number, or a synced contact name. A `@lid` contact is resolved to its phone number; a contact without a known phone number, or a group, is refused.
- The card name is `--name` (only with a single `--contact`), else the contact's alias, name, or system name from the local store, else `+PHONE`.
- Each card carries the number with its WhatsApp ID (`TEL;waid=...`), as WhatsApp's own apps do, so recipients get a Message button.
- The sent message is stored locally with the same `Contact: NAME (+PHONE)` text sync stores for a received card.

## Events

- `send event` creates a WhatsApp event invitation. `--name` and `--start` (RFC3339) are required; `--end` must be after `--start`.
- Events are meant for groups; one-to-one chats are accepted where WhatsApp supports them. Channels and status are refused.
- `--location` is free text. `--join-link` attaches an existing WhatsApp call link (`https://call.whatsapp.com/...`). wacli cannot create call links: whatsmeow has no call-link API, so make the link on the phone and pass it.
- The event carries a fresh 32-byte message secret, which WhatsApp uses to encrypt RSVPs. wacli does not record RSVPs (going / not going); see responses on the phone.
- whatsmeow sends the event with the `event_type=creation` meta node WhatsApp's clients use, but labels the stanza as a text message; if an event does not render on a recipient's phone, that is the likely cause.
- The sent event is stored locally as searchable text (`Event: NAME`, times, location, description). Events received from other devices are stored the same way.

## View once

- `send file --view-once` sends an image or video as view once; `send voice --view-once` (or `send file --ptt --view-once`) sends a view-once voice note. WhatsApp offers view once only for these, so documents, stickers, plain audio, channels, and status are refused before anything is uploaded.
- Images and videos go out in WhatsApp's `viewOnceMessageV2` wrapper and voice notes in `viewOnceMessageV2Extension`, with the media's own `viewOnce` flag set.
- JSON output adds `"view_once": "true"` to the `file` object.
- View-once sends use their own delegate kinds (`file_view_once`, `voice_view_once`), so a `sync --follow` started before this feature refuses them instead of sending an ordinary, re-viewable file. Restart sync after upgrading.
